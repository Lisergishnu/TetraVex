<h1 align="center">TetraVex</h1>
<p align="center">A TetraVex port for macOS</p>

🙌 Introduction
---------

The goal is to port the TetraVex game for the Windows 3.1 OS - famously included in the [Microsoft Best of Entertainment Pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRxfAJqoSgk) - now for macOS using the Cocoa API. To keep the original game graphic style, native draw calls are used to draw the board and buttons, leading to a refreshed style while paying homage to the original game.

⚙️ Build
------

1.- Install CocoaPods:

**gem**
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
**homebrew**
```
brew install cocoapods
```

2. Run pod install in project root directory.
```
pod install
```

3. Open the `TetraVex.xcworkspace` file.
